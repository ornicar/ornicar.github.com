                <h2>The boring introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a passionate <a href="http://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> and CLI user.
                    My quest for better tools led me to use <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a> for every text-related tasks;
                    and my current file manager of choice is <a href="http://nongnu.org/ranger">ranger</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ranger is a really great tool when it comes to browse quickly a complex file tree.
                    It also excels at copying/moving/deleting/opening files. You should be using it.
                <p>
                <h2>The problem</h2>
                <p>
                    As a developer, I spend most of my time manipulating text files, so I often switch from vim to ranger.
                    I wish I can open files in vim from ranger. In fact I can, but ranger will open a new vim instance for each file.
                    I want to launch ranger from vim, and open the file I select in the same vim instance.
                </p>
                <h2>The hope</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the great things about open source software is its hackability.
                    Software, by definition, never does exactly what you need.
                    If you think it does, it means you don't know what you need
                    (or you developed the software you use).
                    vim and ranger beeing open source, let's see how we can manage to make them communicate.
                </p>
                <h2>The code</h2>
                <p>
                    ranger code is hosted on GitHub. I pinged <a href="https://github.com/hut">hut</a>, the author, and he gave me some advices on how getting the thing done. And here is the result.

                <h3>Ranger hack</h3>

                When the INVIM environment variable is set, ranger behavior is slightly changed.
                Instead of launching an application to open a file,
                it will write the file name in /tmp/ranger-selected-file, and quit immediatly.

                <h3>.vimrc tweak</h3>

                When &lt;leader&gt;r is pressed, ranger is launched with INVIM environment variable set to 1.
                After ranger quits, the selected filename is read from /tmp/ranger/selected-file, and vim opens it.

                <h2>It works</h2>
                <p>
                    Yeah it's just that simple. I now have my prefered file manager integrated to my prefered code editor.
                    There is a lot of room for improvements in the quick hacks shown above:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The temp file path should not be harcoded (pass it through the env var?)</li>
                        <li>There is no way to quit ranger without opening a file</li>
                        <li>It will try to open any filetype in vim</li>
                    </ul>
                    But what matters is that, even beeing a python and vimscript beginner, I am able to modify my tools.
